|sPcsxDataOriginPath=|/data/AppData/sony/pcsx/|*Base game save data directory. Each game has an individual sub-directory named after the integer {GAME_ID} field in regional.db eg. `/data/AppData/sony/pcsx/1`. This is the directory `ui_menu` __must__ be launched from.*|

__*Note*__ values **must not** be enclosed within quotes " " as `ui_menu` will use them as part of the path.

## Save States
On launching a game `pcsx` creates `filename.txt`. This contains the path to the file used to launch the game, and a name generated by `pcsx`.

| Actual Path | Parameter Path |
| - | - |
|`/data/AppData/sony/pcsx/.pcsx/filename.txt`|`{Current Working Directory}/.pcsx/filename.txt` |

**Contents**
```
/data/AppData/sony/title/SCES-00002.cue
BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002
```

### Pressing the RESET button **with no existing save state**
`pcsx` creates a save state file, named after the second line of `filename.txt`. `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000`. `000` indicates save state 0. It also creates a screenshot `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.png`.

| Actual Path | Parameter Path |
| - | - |
|`/data/AppData/sony/pcsx/.pcsx/sstates/BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000`|`{Current Working Directory}/.pcsx/sstates/{2nd line of filename.txt}.000` |
|`/data/AppData/sony/pcsx/.pcsx/screenshots/BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.png`|`{Current Working Directory}/.pcsx/screenshots/{2nd line of filename.txt}.png` |

`ui_menu` moves the save state file from `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000` to `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000.res`

| Actual Path | Parameter Path |
| - | - |
|`/data/AppData/sony/pcsx/.pcsx/sstates/BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000.res`|`{sPcsxDataOriginPath}/.pcsx/sstates/{2nd line of filename.txt}.000.res` |

`ui_menu` moves `filename.txt` to `filename.txt.res`. The contents is unchanged from the above.

| Actual Path | Parameter Path |
| - | - |
|`/data/AppData/sony/pcsx/.pcsx/filename.txt.res`|`{sPcsxDataOriginPath}/.pcsx/filename.txt.res` |

### Resuming

### Pressing the RESET button with an existing save state
`pcsx` creates a save state file, named after the second line of `filename.txt`. `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000`.

`ui_menu` checks if `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000.res` exists and as it does it knows this is a new save state. It prompts the user to keep the existing save state, or keep the new one.

![alt text](http://andshrew.github.io/psc/ui_menu/delete_save_state.png "PlayStation Classic Menu keep or new save point")

If the user selects YES to keep the new save point.

`ui_menu` moves the existing save state file from `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000.res` to `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000.bak`

`ui_menu` moves the new save state file from `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000` to `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000.res`

`ui_menu` moves `filename.txt.res` to `filename.txt.res.bak`.

`ui_menu` moves `filename.txt` to `filename.txt.res`. The contents is unchanged from the above.

You can see from this process that `ui_menu` is creating a backup of the original save state, even though there is seemingly no user accessible way to restore this backup.

If you intentionally damage the save state after the backup has been made (ie. delete `BATTLEARENATOSHINDEN-SCES00002.000.res`) then `ui_menu` automatically restores the previous save state. The screenshot however is not restored to the original version as no backup is created of it, instead this remains as the deleted save states screenshot.
